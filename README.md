# LED indicators using an RGB LED

This is a [ZMK module](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules) containing a simple widget that utilizes a (typically built-in) RGB LED controlled by three separate GPIOs. 
It is used to indicate battery level and BLE connection status in a minimalist way.
This module was forked to add brightness control.

### Battery status

- Blink ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ on boot depending on battery level, with thresholds [set](#configuration-details) by `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_HIGH` and `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW`
  - See [options](#battery-levels-for-splits) for showing battery levels for splits
- Blink ðŸ”´ on every battery level change if below critical battery level (`CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_CRITICAL`)

### Connection status

- Blink ðŸ”µ for connected, ðŸŸ¡ for open (advertising), ðŸ”´ for disconnected profiles on boot after the battery blink, and following every BT profile switch (only on central side for splits)
- Blink ðŸ”µ for connected, ðŸ”´ for disconnected on peripheral side of splits

### Layer state

You can pick one of the following methods (off by default) to indicate the highest active layer:

- Enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_CHANGE` to show the highest active layer on every layer activation
  using a sequence of N cyan color blinks, where N is the zero-based index of the layer, or
- Enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_SHOW_LAYER_COLORS` to assign each layer its own color, which will remain on while that layer is the highest active layer

These layer indicators will only be active on the central part of a split keyboard, since peripheral parts aren't aware of the layer information.

> [!TIP]
> Also see [below](#showing-status-on-demand) for keymap behaviors you can use to show the battery and connection status on demand.

## Installation

To use, first add this module to your `config/west.yml` by adding a new entry to `remotes` and `projects`:

```yaml west.yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: olsen-cole  # <-- new entry
      url-base: https://github.com/olsen-cole
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-rgbled-widget  # <-- new entry
      remote: olsen-cole
      revision: main
  self:
    path: config
```

For more information, including instructions for building locally, check out the ZMK docs on [building with modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules#building-with-modules).

Then, if you are using one of the boards supported by the [`rgbled_adapter`](boards/shields/rgbled_adapter) shield such as Xiao BLE,
just add the `rgbled_adapter` as an additional shield to your build, e.g. in `build.yaml`:

```yaml build.yaml
---
include:
  - board: seeeduino_xiao_ble
    shield: hummingbird rgbled_adapter
```
> [!NOTE] 
> PWM is not enabled by default for the supported boards.

For other keyboards, see the ["Adding support" section](#adding-support-in-custom-boardsshields) below.

## Showing status on demand

This module also defines keymap [behaviors](https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors) to let you show battery or connection status on demand:

```dts
#include <behaviors/rgbled_widget.dtsi>  // needed to use the behaviors

/ {
    keymap {
        ...
        some_layer {
            bindings = <
                ...
                &ind_bat  // indicate battery level
                &ind_con  // indicate connectivity status
                ...
            >;
        };
    };
};
```

When you invoke the behavior by pressing the corresponding key (or combo), it will trigger the LED color display.
This will happen on all keyboard parts for split keyboards, so make sure to flash firmware to all parts after enabling.

> [!NOTE]
> The behaviors can be used even when you use split keyboards with different controllers that don't all support the widget.
> Make sure that you use the `rgbled_adapter` shield (or enable `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET` if not using the adapter) only for the keyboard parts that support it.

## Battery levels for splits

For split keyboards, each part will indicate its own battery level with a single battery blink, by default.
However, for some scenarios like keyboards with dongles and no RGBLED widget on the peripherals, you might want the central part to show the battery levels of peripherals too.
This can be done by enabling one of the below settings:

- `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_SHOW_PERIPHERALS`: Blink for battery level of self and then the peripherals, in order
- `CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_SHOW_ONLY_PERIPHERALS`: Blink for battery level of only the peripherals, in order

These two settings only apply to split central parts.
The order of blinks for peripherals is determined by the initial pairing order for the split parts.
If a part is currently disconnected, a magenta/purple ([configurable](#configuration-details)) blink will be displayed.

You can add these settings to your keyboard conf file to modify the config values, e.g. in `config/hummingbird.conf`:

```ini
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_INTERVAL_MS=250
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_HIGH=50
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET_BATTERY_LEVEL_CRITICAL=10
```

## Adding support in custom boards/shields

To be able to use this widget, you need three LEDs controlled by GPIOs (_not_ smart LEDs), ideally red, green and blue colors.
Once you have these LED definitions in your board/shield, simply set the appropriate `aliases` to the RGB LED node labels.

As an example, here are two definitions for the standard three LEDs connected to VCC and separate GPIOs for a nRF52840 controller.
### Basic gpio-leds implementation
```dts
/ {
    aliases {
        led-red = &led0;
        led-green = &led1;
        led-blue = &led2;
    };

    leds {
        compatible = "gpio-leds";
        status = "okay";
        led0: led_0 {
            gpios = <&gpio0 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  // red LED, connected to P0.26
        };
        led1: led_1 {
            gpios = <&gpio0 30 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  // green LED, connected to P0.30
        };
        led2: led_2 {
            gpios = <&gpio0 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;  // blue LED, connected to P0.06
        };
    };
};
```
(If the LEDs are wired between GPIO and GND instead, use `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH` flag.)
### PWM brightness implementation
```dts
/ {
    chosen {
      zephyr,pwm-leds = &pwm_leds;
    };
    aliases {
        led-red = &led0;
        led-green = &led1;
        led-blue = &led2;
    };

    pwm_leds: pwm_leds {
        compatible = "pwm-leds";
        
        led0: led_0 {
            pwms = <&pwm0 0 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED>;
        };
        
        led1: led_1 {
            pwms = <&pwm0 1 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED>;
        };
        
        led2: led_2 {
            pwms = <&pwm0 2 PWM_MSEC(20) PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED>;
        };
    };
};

&pinctrl {
    pwm0_default: pwm0_default {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT0, 0, 2)>,     // Red LED on P0.02
                    <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT1, 0, 29)>,    // Green LED on P0.29
                    <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT2, 0, 31)>;    // Blue LED on P0.31
        };
    };
    pwm0_sleep: pwm0_sleep {
        group1 {
            psels = <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT0, 0, 2)>,     // Red LED on P0.02
                    <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT1, 0, 29)>,    // Green LED on P0.29
                    <NRF_PSEL(PWM_OUT2, 0, 31)>;    // Blue LED on P0.31
            low-power-enable;
        };
    };
};

&pwm0 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-0 = <&pwm0_default>;
    pinctrl-1 = <&pwm0_sleep>;
    pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
};
```

(If the LEDs are wired between GPIO and GND instead, use `PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL` flag.)

Finally, turn on the widget in the configuration:

```ini
CONFIG_RGBLED_WIDGET=y
```
